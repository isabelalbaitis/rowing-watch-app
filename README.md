# **iRow Apple Watch App**
## *CIS 357 Semester project*:
### Summary
This project has the main goal of giving rowers a better user experience when using rowing watch apps. 
The current softwares and apps do not allow the user to achieve their best when rowing on the water with inefficient and confusing to use software designs.

### Goals
Our app aspires to help the rower by giving them their accurate split and stroke rate on the water. 
While also bringing them the total time and periodic split notifications, the watch can help the user track their specific movements on the water
We strive to give our users these features during their row
* Split (min:sec/500m)
* Total time rowed (min:sec)
* Stroke Rate (strokes/min)
* Heartrate (bpm)
* Distance/Stroke (m)

And these features in our app after their row
* Total Meters Rowed (m)
* Informative Graphs to show:
1. Distance per stroke for each stroke during the entire row with statistical data like min and max distance per stroke (m)
2. Stroke Rate for duration of piece with statistical data like min and max stroke rate (spm)
3. Heart Rate for duration of piece with statistical data like min and max heart rate (bpm)
