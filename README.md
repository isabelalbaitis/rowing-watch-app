##**iRow Apple Watch App**##
#*CIS 357 Semester project*:#
This Project has the main goal of giving rowers a better user experience when using rowing watch apps. 
The current softwares and apps do not allow the user to achieve their best when rowing on the water. 
Other apps are inefficient, and confusing to use. 

Our app aspires to help the rower by giving them their accurate split and stroke rate on the water. 
While also bringing them the total time and periodic split notifications, the watch can help the user track their specific movements on the water

Using the GPS, the rower can find their specific course they took during their row
Using the Accelerometer, the rower can find their stroke rate and split to view during specific parts of their row what worked and what needs help.
